The project's landing page contains relevant information for a better
understanding of how the showcase works. It is through it that users can better
understand the advantages of each type of biometrics, including the security
involved in the verification process. In addition, the user will also have at
their disposal tutorials and user manuals to facilitate understanding of the
application's operation and improve usage.

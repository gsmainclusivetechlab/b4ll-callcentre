In developed and developing markets alike, societies are becoming increasingly
digital, and technological innovations are emerging at an ever increasing rate.
The mobile money industry is now fast evolving against a backdrop of increased
internet access and smartphone adoption, the arrival of new tech players, and
consumers’ changing expectations around digital access to financial and other
services. At GSMA Mobile for Development (M4D), we see this as a tremendous
opportunity. With its unparalleled global reach, the mobile industry is uniquely
positioned to drive the technologies that will shape the future of financial and
digital inclusion. For these digital innovations to have real and long-standing
impact, it is incumbent on our industry to ensure scalability, cross-sector
collaboration, and industry standardisation.

The GSMA Inclusive Tech Lab is a dedicated facility that has been set up to
support our industry with inclusive innovations and take a hands-on approach to
research, test and develop the inclusive technologies of the future. By focusing
on research, innovation projects and developing industry assets, the Lab will
aim to produce thought leadership, proofs of concepts / MVPs / prototypes, and
test environments that will aid and assist the ongoing evolution of the mobile
industry. The Lab is a collaborative initiative: Whether it is to do with
digital identity; the availability of credit and insurance; seamless integration
between service providers and mobile money operators; merchant payments;
interoperability; or the application of artificial intelligence to tailor
services for women – the Lab is open to working with a wide range of
stakeholders to further the digital and financial inclusion of the underserved.

If you are interested in collaborating with the Lab to work on these or other
challenges, we would love to hear from you.

title: Call Centre Flow
sidebar_label: Navigation Flow
---

The call centre has the purpose to present the main use cases scenarios for
voice biometrics. We believe that combining these different use cases we can
create new ones to validate different approaches about using voice
recognition/verification.

The main flow the call centre works is presented in the figure below. In the
section use cases it is possible to understand with more detail about the
different use cases available in this flowchart.

There are currently two numbers available to reach the call centre:

-   UK Number: +44 1904 803378

-   US Number: +1 737 245 0200

You can call one of the numbers and navigate in the menu provided.

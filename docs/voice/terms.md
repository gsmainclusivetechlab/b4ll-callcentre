   suppliers offering different biometric solutions, e.g., voice, fingerprint
   and facial recognition. The App allows users to choose the type of biometric
   solution and the use case they would like to experience. In this fashion,
   users can experience the features and functionality of different biometric
   solutions in different use cases.
2. There will be no charge for the users to access or use the App.
3. The User shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of
   governmental entities, having jurisdiction over such performance, including
   (a) maintaining relevant regulatory registrations and notifications as
   required under data protection laws; (b) providing all of the required fair
   processing information to data subjects, and (c) ensuring it has legitimate
   grounds for the processing of personal data, including obtaining all
   necessary consents from data subjects where required. User will protect the
   privacy and legal rights of its end users and other third parties in
   accordance with applicable law.

   AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
   THIS AGREEMENT, TO USER OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY, EXCEED \$100.00. THE EXISTENCE
   OF MULTIPLE CLAIMS WILL NOT SERVE TO ENLARGE THIS LIMITATION. TO THE EXTENT
   THAT A PARTY MAY NOT AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW LIMIT ITS LIABILITY, THE
   SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH LIABILITY SHALL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED BY LAW.
   THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF
   ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN. THE WARRANTY

   OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO.

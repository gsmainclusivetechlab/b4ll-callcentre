To demonstrate the ability to verify a user's identity on inbound calls, we have
created a callback facility. To test this, simply enter your phone number in the
field below - including the international dialling code - and press "Call me!".

import AlertButton from "../../src/frontend/AlertButton"

<AlertButton /> <br/>

:::note Note

The number used here must previously have enrolled a voice asset by calling the
Biometrics For All call centre.

Accessing digitally enabled services often requires customers to identify themselves, both for initial registration and regular use of the services. Initial registration and certain critical actions typically involve the use of a form of foundational identification, such as a national ID. Following registration, in order to use the service on a day-to-day basis, users can (and should) be prompted to authenticate their actions by using a previously set password, most frequently a Personal Identification Number (PIN). Although these models that include the use of national IDs and PINs for authentication are widely used and are working satisfactorily, the typical identification and authentication methodologies described above can cause challenges to certain populations, namely:

1.	More than one billion people in the world lack any form of legal identification, almost half of these living in Sub-Saharan Africa , preventing them from accessing life-enhancing services. The GSMAâ€™s Digital Identity programme focuses on this aspect . 

2.	Authentication and the use of basic commands can be a hurdle for people with disabilities;

3.	Illiterate people, who cannot read or enter the required information on mobile phone screens, could face difficulties to use the services, most of times requiring assistance and reducing the security. 

4.	PIN numbers are easy to forget, making many people keep notes, making it easier to hack or steal information;

5.	Remote onboarding processes can be more costly or even impossible, depending on the user's phone type, such as some featured phones.

The use of biometrics systems can help to reduce some of the challenges mentioned above and also provide other advantages for service providers. These systems can recognize users through their voice, fingerprints, faces, retinas, and so on. Biometric information is always with the user, making it ubiquitous and unique for different systems, measurable, convenient and does not allow sharing, making the enrolment process fast and with credible results . Each type of biometrics has peculiar characteristics that determine its best applicability and the potential to improve access to digital services. For this reason, it is important to take into account parameters such as level of security, acceptability, usability, accuracy, implementation costs, return on investment, required hardware, and others.

In relation to emerging markets, implementation costs and the previous existence of hardware for the use of biometrics are essential. Therefore, during the execution of the trade-off analysis among the several relevant requirements, these characteristics require greater weight in relation to the others. However, the use of biometric systems does not create discrimination between age, sex, race, to name a few. This places service providers at the centre of this changing landscape.

The Biometrics 4 All demo can be used to demonstrate how voice and speech
recognition can be used as a biometric solution for the authentication of mobile
users.

The demo consists of an IVR system that allows a user to call and talk to a
voicebot through a menu of different possibilities, allowing registration and
authentication tests, and demonstrating the potential use of voice and speech
recognition.

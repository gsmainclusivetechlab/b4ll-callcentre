The Biometrics 4 All demo can be used to demonstrate how voice and speech
recognition can be used as a biometric solution for the authentication of mobile
users.

The demo consists of an IVR system that allows a user to call and talk to a
voicebot through a menu of different possibilities, allowing registration and
authentication tests, and demonstrating the potential use of voice and speech
recognition.

To demonstrate the ability to verify a user's identity on inbound calls, we have
created a callback facility. To test this, simply enter your phone number in the
field below - including the international dialling code - and press "Call me!".
Note that the number entered must previously have enrolled a voice identity by
calling the Biometrics For All demonstration number.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Issues are logged on individual project
repositories, but you can view all issues collected together here.

If you'd like to report a new bug, first check that the issue hasn't already
been filed by searching through the board above. If this is a new bug, you can
report it by opening a new issue on the appropriate repository. If you're not
sure which repository is most appropriate for the issue, you can email us
instead at inclusivetechlab@gsma.com.

## Write detailed bug reports

Ensure that your report clearly indicates both the behaviour that you expect to
see, and the behaviour that you are actually seeing. Ideally, please also
include a list of steps to reproduce the error you are seeing. The project
repository should be pre-configured with appropriate issue templates, so please
try to follow those directions!
